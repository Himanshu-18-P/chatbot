It is the world\\'s largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major\\nmanufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in excess of US$46 billion in its fiscal year 2022.\\nThe company was founded on January 25, 1964, as \"Blue Ribbon Sports\", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and\\nofficially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.\\nNike markets its products under its own brand, as well as Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Air Jordan, Nike Blazers, Air Force\\n1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, Nike CR7, and subsidiaries including Air Jordan and Converse\\n(brand). Nike also owned Bauer Hockey from 1995 to 2008, and previously owned Cole Haan, Umbro, and Hurley\\nInternational. In addition to manufacturing sportswear and equipment, the company operates retail stores under the\\nNiketown name. Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the world, with the highly recognized\\ntrademarks of \"Just Do It\" and the Swoosh logo.\\nAs of 2020, it employed 76,700 people worldwide. In 2020, the brand alone was valued in excess of $32 billion, making\\nit the most valuable brand among sports businesses. Previously, in 2017, the Nike brand was valued at $29.6 billion.\\nNike ranked 89th in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\\nFigure0: Headquarters near Beaverton, Oregon, U.S.\\nHistory\\nNike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by University of Oregon track athlete Phil Knight and\\nhis coach, Bill Bowerman, on January 25, 1964. The company initially operated in Eugene, Oregon as a distributor for\\nJapanese shoe maker Onitsuka Tiger, making most sales at track meets out of Knight\\'s automobile.\\nAccording to Otis Davis, a University of Oregon student-athlete coached by Bowerman and Olympic gold medalist at the\\n1960 Summer Olympics, his coach made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting a claim that they were made\\nfor Phil Knight. According to Davis, \"I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. I don\\'t care what all the billionaires say. Bill\\nBowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don\\'t believe me. In fact, I didn\\'t like the way they felt on my feet.\\nThere was no support and they were too tight. But I saw Bowerman made them from the waffle iron, and they were', metadata={'source': 'Nike_Inc_Info.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='mine\".\\nIn its first year in business, BRS sold 1,300 pairs of Japanese running shoes grossing $8,000. By 1965, sales had\\nreached $20,000. In 1966, BRS opened its first retail store at 3107 Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California. In 1967,\\ndue to increasing sales, BRS expanded retail and distribution operations on the East Coast, in Wellesley,\\nMassachusetts.\\nIn 1971, Bowerman used his wife\\'s waffle iron to experiment on rubber to create a new sole for track shoes that would\\ngrip but be lightweight and increase the runner\\'s speed. Oregon\\'s Hayward Field was transitioning to an artificial surface,\\nand Bowerman wanted a sole which could grip to grass or bark dust without the use of spikes. Bowerman was talking to\\nhis wife about this puzzle over breakfast, when the waffle iron idea came into play.\\nBowerman\\'s design led to the introduction of the \"Moon Shoe\" in 1972, so named because the waffle tread was said to\\nresemble the footprints left by astronauts on the moon. Further refinement resulted in the \"Waffle Trainer\" in 1974, which\\nhelped fuel the explosive growth of Blue Ribbon Sports/Nike.\\nTension between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger increased in 1971 as the latter attempted a takeover of BRS by extending an\\nultimatum proposal that would give the Japanese company 51 percent of BRS. In 1972, the relationship between BRS\\nand Onitsuka Tiger came to an end. BRS prepared to launch its own line of footwear. The previous year, it was already\\nable to place from two Japanese shoe manufacturers the company?s first independent order for 20,000, which included\\n6,000 that had the Nike logo. Runner Jeff Johnson was brought in to help market the new brand and was credited for\\ncoining the name ?Nike?. It would bear the Swoosh newly designed by Carolyn Davidson. The Swoosh was first used\\nby Nike on June 18, 1971, and was registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on January 22, 1974.\\nIn 1976, the company hired John Brown and Partners, based in Seattle, as its first advertising agency. The following\\nyear, the agency created the first \"brand ad\" for Nike, called \"There is no finish line\", in which no Nike product was\\nshown. By 1980 Nike had attained a 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market, and the company went public in\\nDecember of that year.\\nWieden+Kennedy, Nike\\'s primary ad agency, has worked with Nike to create many print and television advertisements,\\nand Wieden+Kennedy remains Nike\\'s primary ad agency. It was agency co-founder Dan Wieden who coined the\\nnow-famous slogan \"Just Do It\" for a 1988 Nike ad campaign, which was chosen by Advertising Age as one of the top', metadata={'source': 'Nike_Inc_Info.pdf', 'page': 1})]"
